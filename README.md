# TypewriterOS
A bootable word processor. 

## Purpose
The computing power required to provide everything necessary for writing, and nothing else, is so low that it makes sense to have a simple-to-install OS that can be installed on as many hardware variations as possible to create a robust writing tool.

A mechanical typewriter can serve as a model for this purpose. The drawbacks being the portability (size, weight), the noise while typing, the ink tape, the paper, and the maintenance of its complex mechanisms. These are all addressable with digital means, despite a loss of aesthetic appeal.

A laptop running a typical desktop operating system is more than capable of being a word processor that addresses all of the mentioned drawbacks of a typewriter. Unfortunately, all the other things a laptop is capable of can become detrimental to the act of writing just by being there. A multitasking desktop environment creates a rich source of distraction and *potential* for distraction which undermines the ways a digital word processor addresses the drawbacks of a mechanical typewriter.

When we reduce a laptop to being a keyboard, a screen, and a storage device, without any other functionality we dramatically reduce the amount of computing power required while still satisfying all of the drawbacks of a mechanical typewriter.

If the TypewriterOS is created independent from any specific hardware configuration opportunities are created to make smaller, lighter, more energy efficient, low cost and potentially recycled machines that are very capable for the common task of writing.

## Goal
To create a bootable text editor that will work with computing devices that have the following minimum peripheral hardware:

- display
- keyboard
- internal and/or external storage
- usb port
